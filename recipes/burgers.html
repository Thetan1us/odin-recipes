        This is the traditional, griddled hamburger of diners and takeaway spots, smashed thin and cooked crisp on its edges. It is best to cook in a heavy, cast-iron skillet slicked with oil or fat, and not on a grill. For meat, ask a butcher for coarse-ground chuck steak, with at least a 20 percent fat content, or grind your own. Keep it in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook, and try not to handle it with your fingers — use an ice-cream scoop or spoon instead. Plop down a few ounces in the pan, smash it with a spatula, salt it, let it go crisp and flip. Add cheese and get your bun toasted. The process moves quickly.

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon neutral oil, like canola, or a pat of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck, at least 20 percent fat</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 slices cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>8 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted</li>
        <li> Lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes and condiments, as desired</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil or butter to a large cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet and place over medium heat. Gently divide ground beef into 8 small piles of around 4 ounces each, and even more gently gather them together into orbs that are about 2 inches in height. Do not form patties.
        </li>
        <li>Increase heat under skillet to high. Put half the orbs into the skillet with plenty of distance between them and, using a stiff metal spatula, press down on each one to form a burger that is around 4 inches in diameter and about 1/2 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Cook without moving until patties have achieved a deep, burnished crust, a little less than 2 minutes. Use the spatula to scrape free and carefully turn burgers over. If using cheese, lay slices on meat.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to cook until meat is cooked through, approximately a minute or so longer. Remove burgers from skillet, place on buns and top as desired. Repeat process with remaining burgers. Serving two hamburgers on a single bun is not an outrageous option.
        </li>
    </ol>
